This is the model for the gallic statue

Sadly this gltf file is to large for GIT. 
Therefore it is nessecary to download the statue, open it in blender and add the textures to the materials.
Only the color textures are required. The UV-Map should already exist.
Following this the file needs to be exported as a GLTF
